# BrewFocuser
Arduino based Telescope focuser

Arduino sketch implementing 3 protocols (Moonlight, Optec, and Robofocus) for telescope focuser controller. Using manufacturer protocols means you can use their ASCOM drivers and software control programs directly; no need to write these pieces.

Includes wiring diagram for building the controller (Fritzing format), description of components used, and User Manual.

NOTE - Optec and Robofocus protocols are not fully tested.
